# Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use this script:

## Example 1: Retrieving Facebook Campaign Metrics

reach, impressions, clicks, cost = retrieve_facebook_campaign_metrics(access_token, campaign_id)

print("Facebook Campaign Metrics:")
print(f"Reach: {reach}")
print(f"Impressions: {impressions}")
print(f"Clicks: {clicks}")
print(f"Cost: {cost}")
```

## Example 2: Fetching Google Ad Creative Details

```python
customer_id = "your_google_ads_customer_id"
query = "your_query_condition"

ad_creative_details = fetch_google_ad_creative_details(customer_id, query)

print("Google Ad Creative Details:")
for creative in ad_creative_details:
    print(f"Ad ID: {creative['ad_id']}")
    print(f"Ad Name: {creative['ad_name']}")
    print(f"Headline: {creative['headline']}")
    print(f"Description: {creative['description']}")
```

## Example 3: Scheduling Automated Reports

num_visitors = 1000

result = ab_test(strategy_a, strategy_b, num_visitors)
print(result)
```
