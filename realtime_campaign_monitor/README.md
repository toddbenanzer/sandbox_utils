## Parameters

### `level`
- **Type**: `str`
- **Description**: The logging level to be set. Supported log levels include:
  - `'DEBUG'`: Used for detailed diagnostic output.
  - `'INFO'`: Used for informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
  - `'WARNING'`: Used to indicate potential problems or unexpected events.

## Returns
- **Returns**: `None`

## Functionality
- Upon invocation, the function will:
  - Map the provided logging level string to its corresponding numeric value using Python's built-in logging levels.
  - Set up the basic configuration for logging, including the log format that shows the timestamp, log level, and the log message.
  - Write an initialization message to the log, indicating the logging level that has been set.

## Usage Example



# validate_data Documentation

## Overview
The `validate_data` function is designed to ensure that the provided data adheres to expected formats and contains mandatory fields. It aids in verifying the integrity and completeness of input data before further processing.

## Parameters

### `data`
- **Type**: `Any`
- **Description**: The input data to be validated. It is typically expected to be a dictionary containing various fields relevant to the specific application context.

### `required_fields`
- **Type**: `List[str]`
- **Description**: A list of required keys that must be present in the `data` dictionary. This defines the structure expected from the input data.

## Returns
- **Type**: `Dict[str, Any]`
- **Description**: The function returns a dictionary with the following keys:
  - `is_valid` (bool): A boolean indicating whether the data is valid (`True` if valid, `False` otherwise).
  - `errors` (List[str]): A list of error messages detailing any validation issues identified.

## Functionality
- The function checks if the input data is present and not empty.
- It verifies that all required fields listed in `required_fields` are present in the data dictionary.
- It also checks that string fields are not empty and may include additional type or format checks as necessary.
- If the validation passes, it returns `is_valid` as `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` along with a list of errors encountered during validation.

## Example Usage



# load_config Documentation

## Overview
The `load_config` function loads and parses a configuration file, extracting application settings necessary for the operation of the system. It supports loading configurations in JSON format.
