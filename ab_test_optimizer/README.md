# load_data_from_source Function

## Overview
The `load_data_from_source` function loads data from a specified source and returns it in a DataFrame format, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis using the pandas library.

## Parameters

- `source` (str): 
  - A string representing the data source location, such as a file path to a CSV or Excel file. This can also potentially include URIs for databases (if additional handling is implemented).

## Returns

- `pd.DataFrame`: 
  - The data retrieved from the source, formatted as a pandas DataFrame, which allows for easy data manipulation and analysis.

## Raises

- `FileNotFoundError`: 
  - If the specified file source cannot be found, an error will be raised, and a message will be printed indicating the missing file.

- `ValueError`: 
  - If the source format is unsupported (e.g., a file type that is not recognized), a `ValueError` will be raised with a message indicating the unsupported format.

## Example Usage



# save_results_to_file Function

## Overview
The `save_results_to_file` function saves the provided results to a specified file path in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and Excel. It ensures the directory exists before attempting to save the file.

## Parameters

- `results` (object): 
  - The data or results to save, which can be a pandas DataFrame, dictionary, or list. The function will attempt to convert the provided results into a format suitable for saving.

- `file_path` (str): 
  - A string representing the destination path where the results should be saved, including the file name and extension. The file extension determines the format in which the data will be saved.

## Returns

- None:
  - The function does not return a value. Instead, it writes the results directly to the specified file.

## Raises

- `ValueError`: 
  - Raised if the file path extension is unsupported, indicating that the format cannot be handled by the function.

- `Exception`: 
  - For other unforeseen errors during the file writing process, an error message is printed, and the error is raised.

## Example Usage



# setup_logging_config Function

## Overview
The `setup_logging_config` function configures the logging settings for the application, allowing flexibility in the verbosity and format of log messages. This function establishes a standard logging interface to facilitate tracking and debugging within the application.

## Parameters

- `level` (str): 
  - A string that represents the logging level to be set. Accepted values include:
    - `'DEBUG'`: Detailed information, useful for diagnosing problems.
    - `'INFO'`: General information about application operation.
    - `'WARNING'`: Indications that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future.
    - `'ERROR'`: Serious problems that prevent the program from performing a function.
    - `'CRITICAL'`: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.

## Returns

- None: 
  - The function does not return a value; it configures the logging settings directly.

## Raises

- None: 
  - The function handles any exceptions internally and does not raise any errors to the caller. However, it will print a message if an invalid logging level is provided, defaulting to WARNING.

## Example Usage



# parse_experiment_config Function
