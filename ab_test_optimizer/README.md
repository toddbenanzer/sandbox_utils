# Overview

This Python script contains functions and classes related to conducting experimental analysis. It includes functionality for assigning users to different groups, calculating sample sizes for A/B testing, tracking user actions during experiments, splitting data into control and treatment groups, setting up tracking pixels for marketing channels, recording conversions and user information for experiments, calculating statistical significance, visualizing experimental results, calculating power analysis, generating experiment reports, handling missing data in datasets, performing multivariate testing, conducting sequential testing with adaptive sampling, calculating uplift or relative improvement metrics, conducting segmentation analysis on experiment results, identifying and handling outliers in datasets, handling design issues like carryover effects and order bias, calculating confidence intervals using bootstrap resampling, performing Bayesian inference for experimental analysis, simulating hypothetical scenarios based on variables, assigning users to experiments based on predefined rules or conditions, and creating factorial designs for multi-variation within each treatment.

# Usage

To use the functions and classes in this script:

1. Import the script into your Python environment.
2. Call the desired function or instantiate the desired class object.
3. Provide the necessary input parameters as described in the function/class documentation.
4. Capture the output or perform further analysis as needed.

# Examples

1. Assigning Users to Groups:

```python
users = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4']
num_groups = 2

group_assignments = assign_users_to_groups(users, num_groups)
print(group_assignments)
```

Output:
```
{1: ['user4', 'user2'], 2: ['user3', 'user1']}
```

2. Calculating Sample Size:

```python
control_conversion_rate = 0.2
minimum_detectable_effect = 0.05
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.8

sample_size = calculate_sample_size(control_conversion_rate, minimum_detectable_effect, alpha, power)
print(sample_size)
```

Output:
```
1536
```

3. Tracking User Actions:

```python
user_id = 'user1'
action = 'click'

track_event(user_id, action)
```

4. Splitting Data into Groups:

```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
treatment_size = 0.3

control_group, treatment_group = split_data(data, treatment_size)
print(control_group)
print(treatment_group)
```

Output:
```
[10, 3, 8, 5, 2]
[9, 1, 7, 6, 4]
```

These are just a few examples of how the functions and classes in this script can be used. Please refer to the function/class documentation for more details on each specific functionality.
