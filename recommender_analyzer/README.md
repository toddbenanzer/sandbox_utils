# Overview

This package provides functionality for user-item recommendation systems. It includes various algorithms for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, as well as methods for preprocessing and handling missing values in user-item interaction data. The package also includes functions for evaluating recommendation algorithms, generating recommendations based on popularity, and tuning hyperparameters using grid search. Additionally, it includes functions for analyzing user engagement metrics, visualizing algorithm performance, exploring interaction data characteristics, and handling scalability through Spark. The package supports personalized recommendations based on user preferences and contextual information, diversity-aware recommendations, and recommendations with differential privacy. It also provides explanations for recommended items using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), A/B testing capabilities, and the ability to update recommendations based on user feedback. Finally, the package allows for exporting and importing trained recommendation models using pickle.

You can also export and import trained models using pickle.

# Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the functions provided by this package:

1. Loading user-item interaction data from a file:
```python
data = load_data(file_path)

2. Preprocessing and cleaning user-item interaction data:
```python
cleaned_data = preprocess_data(data)
```

3. Splitting user-item interaction data into training and testing sets:
```python
train_data, test_data = split_data(interaction_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

4. Calculating cosine similarity between two users based on their interactions:
```python
similarity = calculate_similarity(user1, user2)
```

5. Calculating similarity between items based on user interactions:
```python
item_similarity = calculate_item_similarity(user_item_matrix)
```

6. Implementing user-based collaborative filtering:
```python
recommendations = user_based_collaborative_filtering(user_ratings, similarity_matrix, k=5)
```

7. Implementing item-based collaborative filtering:
```python
recommended_items = item_based_cf(data, user_id, item_id, similarity_threshold=0.5, top_n=5)
```
8. Predicting ratings for unseen items using collaborative filtering:
```python
predicted_rating = collaborative_filtering(ratings, similarity_matrix, user_ids, item_ids)
```

9. Evaluating performance of a recommendation algorithm:
```python
precision, recall, fscore = evaluate_recommendation_algorithm(true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives)
```

10. Generating top-N recommendations using collaborative filtering:
```python
recommendation = generate_recommendations(ratings_matrices, N=5)
```

11. Performing matrix factorization using regularized gradient descent:
```python
U_updated, V_updated = matrix_factorization_R(U, V, R, num_iterations=100, learning_rate=0.01, regularization=0.01)
```

12. Applying content-based filtering on item features metadata:
```python
recommended_list = content_based_filtering(users_profile, items, items_features)
```

13. Generating personalized recommendations based on user preferences and contextual information:
```python
personalized_recommendations = personalized_recommendations(users_items_contexts)
```

14. Generating diversity-aware recommendations:
```python
updated_lists = diversity_aware_recomendation(users_lists, diversity_factors)
```

15. Applying differential privacy to recommendations:
```python
noisy_recommendations = apply_differential_privacy(recommendations, epsilon)
```

16. Explaining recommended items using LIME:
```python
explanations = explain_recommended(recommended_data, models)
```

17. Performing A/B testing on recommended items:
```python
result_A, result_B = ab_testing(recommend_A, recommend_B, data)
```

18. Updating recommendations based on user feedback:
```python
updated_recommendations = update_recommendations(feedback, recommended_data)
```

19. Exporting trained recommendation models:
```python
export_models(model_files_names)
```

20. Importing trained recommendation models:
```python
imported_models = import_models(file_names)
```

These are just a few examples of how to use the functions provided by this package. Each function has its own set of parameters and usage guidelines that are described in their respective documentation.
