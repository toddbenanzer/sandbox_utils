# Usage

To use this script, you need to have the following Python packages installed: csv, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy.

Firstly, import the necessary packages:

```python
import csv
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import random
```

Then you can use the provided functions to perform various tasks related to marketing budget optimization.

# Examples

Here are some examples showing how to use the functions in this script:

1. Reading a CSV file:

```python
data = read_csv('data.csv')
```

This function reads a CSV file and returns the data as a list.

2. Cleaning and preprocessing data:

```python
df = clean_and_preprocess_data('data.csv')
```

This function reads a CSV file using pandas and performs cleaning and preprocessing operations such as dropping missing values, converting date columns to datetime format, creating dummy variables for categorical variables, and standardizing numerical variables.

3. Calculating performance metrics:

```python
performance_metrics = calculate_performance_metrics(data)
```

This function calculates average performance metrics for each channel based on historical data.

4. Calculating expected return on investment (ROI):

```python
expected_roi = calculate_expected_roi(performance_data)
```

This function calculates the expected ROI for each channel based on historical performance data.

5. Optimizing budget allocation:

```python
budget_allocation = optimize_budget_allocation(historical_data, expected_roi)
```

This function optimizes the budget allocation across channels based on historical data and expected ROI.

6. Generating a budget report:

```python
report = generate_budget_report(channel_performance, expected_roi)
```

This function generates a budget report that recommends how to allocate the budget across channels based on the performance of each channel and the expected ROI.

7. Visualizing budget allocation:

```python
visualize_budget_allocation(budget_allocation)
```

This function visualizes the budget allocation across channels using a bar plot.

8. Filtering channels based on criteria:

```python
selected_channels = filter_channels(channels, criteria)
```

This function filters channels based on a given criteria and returns a list of selected channels.

9. Calculating average cost per conversion:

```python
avg_cost_per_conversion = calculate_average_cost_per_conversion(marketing_data)
```

This function calculates the average cost per conversion for each channel based on marketing data.

10. Calculating conversion rate:

```python
conversion_rates = calculate_conversion_rate(conversions, impressions)
```

This function calculates the conversion rate for each channel based on the number of conversions and impressions.

11. Calculating return on ad spend (ROAS):

```python
roas_values = calculate_roas(ad_spend, revenue)
```

This function calculates the ROAS for each channel based on the ad spend and revenue.

12. Calculating customer acquisition cost (CAC):

```python
cac_values = calculate_cac(marketing_costs, acquired_customers)
```

This function calculates the CAC for each channel based on the marketing costs and acquired customers.

13. Calculating customer lifetime value (LTV):

```python
ltv = calculate_ltv(customers, revenue)
```

This function calculates the LTV for each channel based on the customers and revenue.

14. Assessing the impact of budget changes:

```python
budget_change_percentage = assess_budget_impact(current_budget, new_budget)
```

This function assesses the impact of budget changes on overall campaign performance and returns the percentage change.

15. Estimating potential reach:

```python
estimated_reach, estimated_impressions = estimate_potential_reach(channel, budget)
```

This function estimates the potential reach and impressions for a given channel and budget.

16. Identifying outliers in data:

```python
outliers = identify_outliers(data)
```

This function identifies outliers in the given data using z-scores.

17. Performing A/B testing:

```python
perform_ab_testing(channel_budgets)
```

This function performs A/B testing by simulating the performance of channels based on random numbers.

18. Evaluating campaign scenarios:

```python
scenario_performance = evaluate_scenario(scenario)
```

This function evaluates the performance of a campaign scenario by simulating the performance based on random numbers.

19. Simulating campaign scenarios:

```python
scenarios_performance = simulate_scenarios(num_scenarios)
```

This function simulates multiple campaign scenarios by generating random scenarios and evaluating their performance.

20. Comparing campaign performance against projected results:

```python
comparison_results = compare_campaign_performance(actual_results, projected_results)
```

This function compares the actual campaign performance against projected results and returns a dictionary with the differences in metrics.

21. Analyzing customer behavior:

```python
analysis_results = analyze_customer_behavior(marketing_data)
```

This function analyzes customer behavior and preferences based on marketing data.

22. Calculating correlation between budget allocation and campaign results:

```python
correlation_coefficient = calculate_correlation(budget_allocation, campaign_results)
```

This function calculates the correlation coefficient between the budget allocation and campaign results.

23. Predicting campaign performance:

```python
predicted_performance = predict_campaign_performance(historical_data, market_conditions)
```

This function predicts the future performance of campaigns based on historical data and current market conditions.

24. Recommending budget adjustments:

```python
recommended_adjustments = recommend_budget_adjustments(current_allocation, desired_changes)
```

This function recommends budget adjustments based on changes in market dynamics or campaign goals.

These are just a few examples of how to use the functions in this script. You can combine them in different ways to perform more complex tasks related to marketing budget optimization.
