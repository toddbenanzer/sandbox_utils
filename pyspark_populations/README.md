# Package Name

This package provides a set of functions for working with Spark DataFrames and visualizing data using Matplotlib.

## Overview

The package consists of several functions that perform common operations on Spark DataFrames, such as reading data from different file formats, filtering, selecting, joining, grouping, and performing various calculations on the data. Additionally, the package provides functions for visualizing data using Matplotlib.

## Usage

To use this package, you need to have PySpark installed. Once you have PySpark installed, you can import the package by adding the following line to your Python script:

```python
from pyspark_dataframe_utils import *
```

After importing the package, you can use any of the available functions by calling them with the appropriate arguments.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use some of the functions provided by this package:

### Example 1: Reading a CSV file into a DataFrame

```python
file_path = "path/to/file.csv"
df = read_csv_to_dataframe(file_path)
```

This will read the CSV file located at `file_path` into a DataFrame.

### Example 2: Filtering a DataFrame

```python
condition = "column_name > 10"
filtered_df = filter_dataframe(df, condition)
```

This will filter the DataFrame `df` based on the given condition and return a new filtered DataFrame.

### Example 3: Calculating the sum of a column

```python
column_name = "column_name"
sum_value = calculate_sum(df, column_name)
```

This will calculate the sum of values in the column `column_name` in the DataFrame `df` and return the result.

### Example 4: Visualizing a histogram

```python
visualize_histogram(df, "column_x", "column_y")
```

This will visualize a histogram based on the values in columns `column_x` and `column_y` in the DataFrame `df`.

## Conclusion

This package provides a convenient set of functions for working with Spark DataFrames and visualizing data. By utilizing these functions, you can easily perform various operations on your data and generate meaningful visualizations.
