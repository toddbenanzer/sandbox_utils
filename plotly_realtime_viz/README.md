# Overview

This package provides a set of functions for fetching, preprocessing, and visualizing data using the Plotly library. It includes functions for fetching data from an API or a database, preprocessing the data, filtering the data based on certain criteria, and transforming the data into suitable formats for different types of Plotly charts. It also includes functions for creating real-time charts such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps.

# Usage

To use this package, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following dependencies:

- `requests`
- `sqlite3`
- `plotly`
- `numpy`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests sqlite3 plotly numpy
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can import the functions from the package in your Python script or interactive session.

```python
import requests
import sqlite3
import time
import random
from itertools import count
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.offline import iplot
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np
```

# Examples

Here are some examples that demonstrate how to use the functions provided by this package.

## Fetching Data from an API

You can use the `fetch_data_from_api(url)` function to fetch data from an API. The function takes a URL as input and returns the fetched data in JSON format.

```python
data_url = "https://api.example.com/data"
data = fetch_data_from_api(data_url)
```

## Fetching Data from a Database

You can use the `fetch_data_from_database(database, query)` function to fetch data from a SQLite database. The function takes a database file path and a SQL query as inputs and returns the fetched data as a list of rows.

```python
database_file = "data.db"
query = "SELECT * FROM table"
data = fetch_data_from_database(database_file, query)
```

## Preprocessing Data

You can use the `preprocess_data(data)` function to preprocess the fetched data. This function takes the raw data as input and performs necessary preprocessing steps such as cleaning the data, removing outliers, converting data types, etc. The function should return the preprocessed data.

```python
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)
```

## Filtering Data

You can use the `filter_data(data, criteria)` function to filter the data based on certain criteria. This function takes the data and a criteria function as inputs and returns the filtered data. The criteria function should take a single data point as input and return True or False based on whether the data point satisfies the filtering condition.

```python
def criteria(d):
    # Filtering condition
    return d['value'] > 0

filtered_data = filter_data(data, criteria)
```

## Transforming Data for Plotly

You can use the `transform_data(data)` function to transform the fetched or filtered data into a suitable format for Plotly charts. This function takes either a list or a pandas DataFrame as input and returns the transformed data in a Plotly figure.

```python
fig = transform_data(filtered_data)
```

## Creating Real-time Line Charts

You can use the `create_realtime_line_chart()` function to create a real-time line chart using Plotly. This function continuously updates the chart with new data points at regular intervals.

```python
create_realtime_line_chart()
```

## Creating Real-time Bar Charts

You can use the `create_realtime_bar_chart(data)` function to create a real-time bar chart using Plotly. This function continuously updates the chart with new data at regular intervals. The input `data` can be a pandas DataFrame or a list of dictionaries.

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]})
create_realtime_bar_chart(data)
```

## Creating Real-time Scatter Plots

You can use the `create_realtime_scatterplot()` function to create a real-time scatter plot using Plotly. This function continuously updates the plot with new data points at regular intervals.

```python
create_realtime_scatterplot()
```

## Creating Real-time Pie Charts

You can use the `create_realtime_pie_chart(data)` function to create a real-time pie chart using Plotly. This function continuously updates the chart with new data at regular intervals. The input `data` should be a dictionary with labels as keys and corresponding values.

```python
data = {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3}
create_realtime_pie_chart(data)
```

## Creating Real-time Heatmaps

You can use the `create_realtime_heatmap()` function to create a real-time heatmap using Plotly. This function continuously updates the heatmap with new data at regular intervals.

```python
create_realtime_heatmap()
```

## Updating a Chart

You can use the `update_chart(new_x, new_y)` function to update an existing line chart with new data points. This function takes the x and y values of the new data point as inputs and adds them to the existing chart.

```python
update_chart(5, 10)
```
