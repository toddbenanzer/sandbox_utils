# Package Name

## Overview

The **Package Name** is a collection of Python scripts that provide various data visualization and analysis functionalities. This package utilizes popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` to create visualizations and perform analysis on data.

## Usage

To use the **Package Name**, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can import the necessary functions from the **Package Name** into your Python script using the following import statement:

```python
from package_name import function_name
```

You can then call the imported function with the required parameters to perform the desired visualization or analysis.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Histogram Visualization

```python
import pandas as pd
from package_name import create_histogram_visualization

data = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C': [7, 8, 9]})
column_name = 'A'
output_file = 'histogram.csv'

create_histogram_visualization(data, column_name, output_file)
```

This example demonstrates how to create a histogram visualization for a specific column in a DataFrame. The resulting histogram will be saved as a CSV file.

### Example 2: Creating a Scatter Plot

```python
import pandas as pd
from package_name import create_scatter_plot

data = pd.DataFrame({'X': [1, 2, 3], 'Y': [4, 5, 6]})

create_scatter_plot(data, 'X', 'Y')
```

This example shows how to create a scatter plot using the `create_scatter_plot` function. The scatter plot will display the relationship between the 'X' and 'Y' columns in the given DataFrame.

### Example 3: Creating a Bar Chart

```python
import pandas as pd
from package_name import create_bar_chart

data = pd.DataFrame({'X': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'Y': [1, 2, 3]})

bar_chart_html = create_bar_chart(data, 'X', 'Y')
print(bar_chart_html)
```

In this example, we use the `create_bar_chart` function to generate an HTML representation of a bar chart. The resulting HTML code can be embedded in web pages or viewed in a browser.

These examples provide a glimpse into the functionality of the **Package Name**. For more detailed usage instructions and additional examples, please refer to the documentation provided with the package.
