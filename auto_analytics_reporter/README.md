# Python Script Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the functionality of the Python script. It includes details on how to use the script, examples of its usage, and explanations of key functions.

## Overview

The Python script provides various functions for data processing, analysis, and visualization. It includes functions for reading CSV files, fetching data from a URL, connecting to a database, cleaning data, calculating summary statistics, visualizing data, generating reports, saving data to files, handling exceptions, and more.

## Usage

To use the script, you need to import it into your Python environment or script. You can then call the different functions provided by the script as needed.

Here is an example of how to import and use the `read_csv_file` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Import the script
import my_script

# Read a CSV file
data = my_script.read_csv_file("data.csv")

# Perform operations on the data...
```

## Examples

Here are some examples showcasing the usage of different functions provided by the script:

1. Reading a CSV file:

```python
data = my_script.read_csv_file("data.csv")
```

2. Fetching data from a URL:

```python
url = "https://example.com/data"
data = my_script.fetch_data(url)
```

3. Connecting to a database:

```python
host = "localhost"
username = "root"
password = "password"
database = "my_db"
connection = my_script.connect_to_database(host, username, password, database)
```

4. Cleaning data:

```python
cleaned_data = my_script.clean_data(data)
```

5. Calculating summary statistics:

```python
summary_stats = my_script.generate_summary_statistics("data.csv")
```

6. Visualizing data:

```python
data = {"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]}
plot_type = "bar"
my_script.visualize_data(data, plot_type)
```

7. Generating reports:

```python
data = [{"Name": "John", "Age": 25}, {"Name": "Jane", "Age": 30}]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
format_options = ["bold"]
report = my_script.create_report(data, columns, format_options)
```

8. Handling exceptions:

```python
@my_script.handle_exceptions
def my_function():
    # Code that may raise an exception

my_function()
```

9. Saving data:

```python
data = [1, 2, 3]
filename = "data.pkl"
my_script.save_data(data, filename)
```

10. Performing feature selection:

```python
X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
y = [0, 1, 0]
k = 1
X_selected = my_script.perform_feature_selection(X, y, k)
```

These are just a few examples of how the script can be used. Refer to the function documentation for more details on the parameters and return values of each function.

## Conclusion

The Python script provides a wide range of functionality for data processing, analysis, and visualization. It can be used to read CSV files, fetch data from URLs, connect to databases, clean data, calculate summary statistics, visualize data, generate reports, save data to files, handle exceptions, and more.
