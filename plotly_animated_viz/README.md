# Examples

### Creating an Animated Line Plot

To create an animated line plot, you can use the `create_animated_line_plot` function. This function takes two arrays as input - `x` and `y`, which represent the x and y coordinates of the points in the plot. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
import numpy as np
import animated_plotly_package as app

# Generate some random data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create the animated line plot
fig = app.create_animated_line_plot(x, y)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

### Creating an Animated Bar Plot

To create an animated bar plot, you can use the `create_animated_bar_plot` function. This function takes a dictionary as input - `data`, where each key represents a category and each value represents the height of the bar for that category. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
import animated_plotly_package as app

# Define the data
data = {"Category 1": [1, 2, 3], "Category 2": [4, 5, 6]}

# Create the animated bar plot
fig = app.create_animated_bar_plot(data)

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

### Creating an Animated Scatter Plot

To create an animated scatter plot, you can use the `create_animated_scatter_plot` function. This function takes a pandas DataFrame as input - `data`, and three strings - `x`, `y`, and `animation_column`, where `x` and `y` represent the column names for the x and y coordinates of the points in the plot, and `animation_column` represents the column name for the variable that will be used to animate the plot. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python

import animated_plotly_package as app

# Create a DataFrame with some sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "x": [1, 2, 3],
    "y": [4, 5, 6],
    "animation_column": ["A", "B", "C"]
})

# Create the animated scatter plot
fig = app.create_animated_scatter_plot(data, "x", "y", "animation_column")

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

### Creating an Animated Area Plot

To create an animated area plot, you can use the `create_animated_area_plot` function.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
import numpy as np
import animated_plotly_package as app

# Generate some random data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)

# Create the animated area plot

```

### Controlling Playback Speed and Direction

To control the playback speed and direction of an animation, you can use the `control_playback` function. This function takes two optional arguments - `speed` and `direction`, which represent the playback speed and direction of the animation. The default values are 1 for speed (normal speed) and "forward" for direction. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
import animated_plotly_package as app

# Create a Plotly figure object
fig = app.create_animated_line_plot(x, y)

### Skipping Time Intervals in Animations

To skip over time intervals in animations, you can use the `skip_time` function. This function takes two arguments - `animation`, which represents the Plotly animation object, and `time_steps`, which is an integer representing the number of steps to skip forward (positive value) or backward (negative value). Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
import animated_plotly_package as app

# Create a Plotly animation object
animation = app.create_animation_object(fig)

# Skip forward 3 time steps in the animation
new_frame_index = app.skip_time(animation, 3)
```

### Repeating Animation Code

To repeat over animations using a specified number of times, you can use the `repeats_animation_code` function. This function takes two arguments - `num_repeats`, which is an integer representing the number of times to repeat the animation code, and `animations_code`, which is a string representing the animation code to be repeated. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python

# Define the animation code
animation_code = """
fig = app.create_animated_line_plot(x, y)
"""

# Repeat the animation code 3 times
app.repeats_animation_code(3, animation_code)
```

### Synchronizing Multiple Animations

To synchronize multiple animations together, you can use the `synchronize_animations` function. This function takes one argument - `animations`, which is a list of Plotly figure objects representing the animations. Here is an example of how to use this function:

fig2 = app.create_animated_line_plot(x2, y2)

# Synchronize the animations
app.synchronize_animations([fig1, fig2])
```
