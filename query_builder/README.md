# Python Script Documentation

## Overview
This Python script provides functions for reading and parsing CSV files, validating data, transforming data into SQL queries using Jinja templates, executing SQL queries on a Teradata database, exporting query results to CSV files, and handling null or missing values in data.

## Usage
To use this script, you will need to have the `csv`, `jinja2`, and `teradatasql` packages installed in your Python environment. These packages can be installed using pip:

```
pip install csv jinja2 teradatasql
```

Once the required packages are installed, you can import the functions from the script into your own Python code and use them as needed.

## Examples

### Reading a CSV file
To read a CSV file and return its content as a list of dictionaries, you can use the `read_csv_file` function. This function takes the path to the CSV file as an argument and returns a list of dictionaries representing each row in the CSV file.

```python
data = read_csv_file('path/to/file.csv')
print(data)
```

### Parsing a CSV file
To parse a CSV file and extract only relevant columns, you can use the `parse_csv` function. This function takes the path to the CSV file and a list of relevant columns as arguments, and returns a list of dictionaries representing each row in the CSV file with only the relevant columns.

```python
data = parse_csv('path/to/file.csv', ['column1', 'column2'])
print(data)
```

### Validating data
To validate data against specific rules or conditions, you can use the `validate_data` function. This function takes the data to be validated as an argument and performs validation logic on it. If any validation fails, an exception will be raised.

```python
data = {'customer': 'John Doe', 'account': '12345', 'transactions': [100, 200, 300]}
validate_data(data)
```

### Transforming data to SQL queries
To transform data into SQL queries using Jinja templates, you can use the `transform_data_to_sql` function. This function takes the data as an argument and renders a Jinja template with the provided data. The resulting SQL query is returned.

```python
data = {'date_snapshot': '2022-01-01'}
sql_query = transform_data_to_sql(data)
print(sql_query)
```

### Generating a CTE for joining entities over time
To generate a common table expression (CTE) for joining entities over time, you can use the `generate_join_cte` function. This function takes lists of entities, entity aliases, join conditions, and date columns as arguments, and returns the generated CTE for joining the entities over time.

```python
entities = ['customer', 'account', 'transactions']
entity_alias = {'customer': 'c', 'account': 'a', 'transactions': 't'}
join_condition = {'customer': 'c.id = a.customer_id', 'account': 'a.id = t.account_id'}
date_column = {'customer': 'c.date', 'account': 'a.date', 'transactions': 't.date'}
cte_query = generate_join_cte(entities, entity_alias, join_condition, date_column)
print(cte_query)
```

### Generating a CTE for aggregating data at different levels
To generate a common table expression (CTE) for aggregating data at different levels, you can use the `generate_aggregation_cte` function. This function takes the desired aggregation level as an argument ('account' or 'customer') and returns the generated CTE.

```python
level = 'account'
cte_query = generate_aggregation_cte(level)
print(cte_query)
```

### Generating a SQL query with dynamic parameters
To generate a SQL query with dynamic parameters, you can use the `generate_sql_query` function. This function takes the date and customer ID as arguments and renders a Jinja template with the provided data. The resulting SQL query is returned.

```python
date = '2022-01-01'
customer_id = 12345
sql_query = generate_sql_query(date, customer_id)
print(sql_query)
```

### Executing a SQL query on a Teradata database
To execute a SQL query on a Teradata database, you can use the `execute_query` function. This function takes the SQL query as an argument and returns the result set.

```python
query = 'SELECT * FROM customers'
result = execute_query(query)
print(result)
```

### Exporting query results to a CSV file
To export query results to a CSV file, you can use the `export_query_results_to_csv` function. This function takes the SQL query and the filename for the CSV file as arguments, executes the query, fetches the results, creates a DataFrame from the results, and exports it to the specified CSV file.

```python
query = 'SELECT * FROM customers'
filename = 'output.csv'
export_query_results_to_csv(query, filename)
```

These are just a few examples of how to use the functions in this script. For more information on each function and its parameters, refer to the function docstrings in the script itself.
